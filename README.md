# Public Sector Machine Learning

Machine learning is becoming more common in marketing, business, and medicine. The public sector can certainly benefit from this technology as well. Plenty of data already exists. When properly cleaned machine learning can be applied to predict problems, target resources and protect lives and property. This project serves as an example of how communities can use data to inform prevention and reduce fire burden. Like most data analytics project, wrangling data was the main challenge. This project started with fire dispatch data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=fire+dispatch) from 1/1/2018 through 5/7/2021. As time moved forward, it became clear that the machine learning tools required more diverse data points pertaining to fire risk. After the weighty task of cleaning this cumbersome dataset, NYC Open Data datasets on [housing maintenance code violations code violation](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5), [police complaints](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i), [environmental control](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-ECB-Violations/6bgk-3dad)  and [vacate orders](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Order-to-Repair-Vacate-Orders/tb8q-a3ar). In the end, this process proved to be very challenging, but worth the effort in future public safety.

## Dashboard
-The dashboard is comprised of two pages. The basic overview of the project and a page for the machine learning analysis and visuals.<br>
-It includes a heatmap showing the various street alarm boxes and their frequency of use.<br> 
-The overview includes graphs of the incident types by borough and by borough and fire-type (structural or non-structural)<br>
