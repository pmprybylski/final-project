# Public Sector Machine Learning

Machine learning is becoming more common in marketing, business, and medicine. The public sector has plenty of room to benefit from this technology as well. Plenty of data already exists. When properly cleaned machine learning can be applied to predict problems, target resources and protect lives and property. This project serves as an example of how communities can use data to inform prevention and reduce fire burden. Like most data analytics project, wrangling data was the main challenge. We used fire dispatch data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=fire+dispatch). As time moved forward, it became clear that the machine learning tools required more diverse data points pertaining to fire risk. After the weighty task of cleaning this cumbersome dataset, NYC Open Data datasets on [housing code violation](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5), [police calls](addLink), and [home evictions](addLink).
